//! Keira Kernel: PC Speaker Sound Driver (Rust FFI Wrapper)
//!
//! Safe Rust interface to the C PC Speaker driver (`drivers/sound/`).
//!
//! These functions call into C via FFI. The C driver handles the actual
//! hardware interaction (PIT Channel 2 programming and speaker gate control
//! via `outb`/`inb` instructions on ports 0x42, 0x43, and 0x61).
//!
//! Why wrap C functions instead of reimplementing in Rust?
//!   - Keeps hardware I/O port access centralized in the C driver layer.
//!   - Avoids duplicating inline assembly for `outb`/`inb`.
//!   - Demonstrates the C↔Rust interop that is central to Keira's design.
