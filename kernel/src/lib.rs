//! Keira Kernel: Crate Root
//!
//! This is the root of the Rust kernel crate. It operates in a fully
//! freestanding environment:
//!   - `no_std`:  No Rust standard library (no OS underneath us!)
//!   - `no_main`: No standard main() entry point (ASM calls us directly)
//!
//! The kernel uses only `core` : the subset of Rust that requires zero
//! OS support. All I/O is performed through FFI calls to C drivers.

// Module declarations

pub mod shell;
pub mod syscall;

/// Panic handler : required by `no_std` to handle panics gracefully.
pub mod panic;
